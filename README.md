# Spotube
## Enables users to obtain youtube links of all the videos in their Spotify playlists by integrating the Spotify API and the Youtube Data v3 API
- If you wish to use the app through the deployment, send a request through the website (ensure that the email you use is the one linked with your Spotify account)
- This is necessary as Spotify only allows the email IDs that the developer of the app authorizes, to use the app
- Also your playlists will be restricted to 100 songs per playlist, because well, YouTube's quota restrictions :')

### Functionalities
1) Obtain the youtube video links to all the songs in a playlist of your Spotify library
2) Also capable of converting an external playlist, provided it's link, and storing it in your account
3) Convert songs individually
4) Built-In YouTube videoplayer
5) Storage of previously converted playlists to your account for future access
6) Reduces API calls by preventing reconversion of previously converted playlists
